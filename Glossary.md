### Terms and Definitions Taken Directly from SJV Glossary: <link>https://community.valleyair.org/media/3324/glossary-of-terms_12821.pdf</link>
- **AB 617** – Assembly Bill (AB) 617 (C. Garcia, Chapter 136, Statutes of 2017) directs the state and local air districts to identify communities in California that are exposed to high levels of air pollution and established the Community Air Protection Program. Air districts with input from residents and stakeholders are to develop community focused action plans and community air monitoring plans to address localized air pollution and reduce exposure to particulate matter and toxic air contaminants.
- **Black Carbon** – Black carbon is the sooty black material emitted from gasoline and diesel engines, and other sources that burn fossil fuel. It comprises a significant portion of particulate matter. Inhalation of black carbon is associated with health problems including respiratory and cardiovascular disease, cancer, and birth defects.
- **California Air Resources Board (CARB)** – The State of California agency responsible for air pollution control. Responsibilities include: establishing State ambient air quality standards, setting allowable emission levels for mobile sources of emissions and consumer products.
- **Cancer Risk** – The likelihood that a person will develop cancer during their lifetime.
- **Carbon Monoxide (CO)** - a colorless, odorless gas emitted from combustion processes like mobile sources.
- **Concentrations** – Pollution in the air is typically expressed as a concentration. A concentration is the amount that could be extracted from a given volume of air (like a cubic meter). For example, the amount of particulate matter concentrations in terms of “micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3).” This is a measure of the amount of particulate matter collected if you were to draw a cubic meter of air through a clean filter, and then weigh the filter on a scale that can measure millionths of a gram. Today we would expect, on average, to be able to collect about 10 μg of PM2.5 from a cubic meter of ambient air.
- **Criteria Air Pollutants** – As required by the Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identifies and set standards to protect human health and welfare for six pollutants: ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, lead, and nitrogen oxide. The term "criteria pollutants" derives from the requirement that the U.S. EPA must describe the characteristics and potential health and welfare effects of these pollutants. U.S. EPA periodically reviews new scientific data and may propose revisions to the standards as a result.
- **Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM)** – The particles found in the exhaust of diesel-fueled compression ignition engines. Diesel PM may combine and adsorb other species to form structures of complex physical and chemical properties.
- **Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)** – The federal agency in charge of creating and enforcing regulations to protect human health and the environment.
- **Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5)** – Particulate matter (PM) is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air. Of these particles, those less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, called fine PM or PM2.5, pose the greatest risk to health. See particulate matter.
- **Greenhouse Gases (GHG)** – Any gas that absorbs infrared radiation in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), halogenated fluorocarbons (HCFCs), ozone (O3), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
- **Health Risk Assessment (HRA)** – A detailed comprehensive analysis to evaluate and predict the dispersion of hazardous substances in the environment and the potential for exposure of human populations, and to assess and quantify both the individual and population wide health risks associated with those levels of exposure.
- **Mobile Sources Of Air Pollution** – Any motor vehicle that produces air pollution, e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles (on-road mobile sources) or airplanes, trains and construction equipment (off-road mobile sources).
- **National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)** – The Clean Air Act requires U.S. EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) at a levels determined to be protective of public health within an adequate margin of safety for six pollutants referred to as criteria pollutants. Standards are set based on scientific research and policy assessments reviewed by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee.
- **Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)** - or “oxides of nitrogen” is a group of gases that are composed of nitrogen and oxygen. Two of the most common nitrogen oxides are nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).
- **Ozone (O3)** - ground level or “bad” ozone which is not emitted directly into the air, it is created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of sunlight.
- **Particulate Matter (PM)** – PM includes a wide range of particles that vary in terms of their size and mass, physical state (solid or liquid), chemical composition, toxicity, and how they behave and transform in the atmosphere. PM is commonly characterized based on particle size. Ultrafine PM includes the very smallest particles less than 0.1 micron in diameter (one micron equals one-millionth of a meter). Fine PM, commonly referred to as PM2.5, consists of particles 2.5 microns or less in diameter (includes ultrafine PM). Coarse PM refers to particles between 2.5 microns and 10 microns in diameter. The term “coarse” particles may be misleading; it should be emphasized that even “coarse” particles are still very tiny, many times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. PM10 consists of particles 10 microns or less in diameter (includes ultrafine, fine and coarse PM).
- **Parts per Billion (ppb)** – A weight-to-weight ratio used to describe concentrations. Parts per billion (ppb) is the number of units of mass of a contaminant in the air per 1000 million units of total mass.
- **Parts per Million (ppm)** – A weight-to-weight ratio used to describe concentrations. Parts per million (ppm) is the number of units of mass of a contaminant in the air per million units of total mass.
- **Sensitive Receptors** – Members of the population that are particularly sensitive to the effects of air pollutants, such as children, the elderly, and people with illnesses.
- **Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs)** – TACs are air pollutants, identified by CARB, which may cause or contribute to an increase in deaths or in serious illness, or which may pose a present or potential health hazard. Health effects may occur at extremely low levels of TACs.
- **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)** - are a large group of carbon-based chemicals that easily become vapors or gases. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds.

- **Ammonium Nitrate** - Ammonium nitrate is formed from the reaction of ammonia and nitric acid, where the nitric acid is formed from emissions of nitrogen oxides.
- **Ammonium Sulfate** - Ammonium sulfate is form from the reaction of ammonia and sulfuric acid, where the sulfuric acid is formed primarily from emissions of sulfur oxide, with smaller amounts forming from direct emissions of sulfur.
- **Organic carbon** - Organic carbon (OC) are generated as primary organic aerosol, predominantly through the combustion of hydrocarbons. Key sources include cooking, industrial processes, mobile source exhaust, tire wear, and wood burning. Secondary organic aerosols are formed from the oxidation of motor vehicle hydrocarbons, wood burning, solvent use, and industrial processes.
- **Black Carbon** - Black carbon is also known as soot or elemental carbon, and is formed during incomplete combustion in fuels, including mobile exhaust (mainly diesel) and wood burning.
- **Soil** - This category consists of road dust and soil dust that are entrained in the air from activity, such as soil disturbance or airflow from traffic.
- **Other Metals** - Identified as components from soil emissions or found in other particulates having been emitted in connection with combustion from engine wear, brake wear, and similar processes. Certain metals are also emitted from the use of fireworks.
