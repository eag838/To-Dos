## Uncategorized Stuff
- Would be good to have a table or documentation on conventions with duration/frequency (e.g., Clarity)
 

## Short Term To-Dos
- Define color gradient for display of non-criteria pollutants on map (per OEHHA, can't use 1-hr RELs - maybe use a statewide relative scale?)


## Longer Term To-Dos
- Web page explainer for QA/QC
- How to display toxics data in AQview 
  - Maybe we can display a static map with toxics monitoring site locations
  - When a user clicks on a site, maybe they can get some kind of visual summary, list of pollutants, link to data or reports, etc.?
  - When a user clicks on a site, maybe it can also populate plot(s) below the map as in our realtime map (except it would be limited to one site, not 4)
