# Toxics Notes
## Health Messaging

### OEHHA health values:
- REL (Reference Exposure Level)
  - Roughly like the "yellow" AQI category (REAMAR notes from RB 20120508)
  - It is not likely to see health effects at or below the REL with normal individuals (OEHHA reps meeting 20200508)
  - 8-hour REL is a misnomer; not based on time exposure but average breathing rate of workers, 8-hour REL will almost always be 2x chronic; convenience for HARP (OEHHA reps meeting recording 20200508)
- Hazard index
  - Note: some communities could always have HI > 1 because background may stay above level of concern over sustained period of time (REAMAR notes from RB 20120508)
- AEGL
  - Designed for very brief exposure; evacuation level (REAMAR notes from RB 20120508)
- TEEL 
  - Dev by toxicologist at DOE thorough toxicology review – not all are based on AEGLs but some are; slightly more rigorous and updated more often than AEGL (REAMAR notes from RB 20120508)
  - Designed for very brief exposure; evacuation level (REAMAR notes from RB 20120508)
- CSF (Cancer Slope Factor)



### Snippets from meeting notes:
- Application of OEHHA Health Values: (REAMAR notes from RB 20120508)
  - Avoid putting in cancer risk values for meas values unless they’re similar year round 
  - Display RT data and hourly averages rolling compared to acute RELs
  - On monthly basis, update the mean concentrations since monitoring started for comparison to chronic RELs
  - Calculate rolling monthly mean as new data come in for comparison with chronic REL 

- Black Carbon:
  - Consider treating like PM2.5 since BC is a fraction of PM2.5; weight to toxicity levels (OEHHA health metrics and AQview meeting 20201210)


- VOCs:
  - Use a risk assessment approach? Think about some sort of trigger or threshold(?) (OEHHA health metrics and AQview meeting 20201210)
