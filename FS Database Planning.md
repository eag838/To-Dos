## Wishlist

- add DataProviderId, SiteId, MonitorId, StreamId to metadata tables 
  - add data provider id to monitor table


## New procedures/fixes
- need way of dealing with Adjustments that aren't adjustments (e.g., SJV sending AObs as raw value and AObsAdj as truncated values/negatives to zero)
